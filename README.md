# KudosPhishing
This assignment was supposed to be a simple attempt to "social engineer" our professor. I decided to take the assignment to the next level by creating a robust webpage that takes as much information as I can about a user without doing something illicit or ethically wrong. Once the user is sent an email, if they click on the link, it will redirect them to my website where I grab their IP and browser information before redirecting them to the YouTube video of Rick Astley's never gonna give you up.

This attack works mostly because there was such a thing as the RIT kudos page, but it has since been deprecatecd.

## Future Improvements
1. I'd like to add a web form for sending out one of these emails, but I also need a check to make sure that not just anyone can send one out.
- Maybe a passoword or secret parameter? Who knows.
2. I'd like to make the alert email that I receive when someone visits the site more visually appealing, ideally with some styling and graphics
- I might use some CSS and backend graphics generation to create a map with a pinpoint on it
3. I might consider adding additional code to pull more information about the user, but I'm not sure what else to add...
